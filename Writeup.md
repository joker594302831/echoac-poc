### I would like to politely ask - please do **not** go and harass any of the people mentioned. While some of them have gone too far in many aspects, and have been pretty vile towards me - harassment is never okay. We shouldn't stoop to their level. Thanks.

## Echo and data
Echo.ac is pretty quiet about the data it collects and why. Their own ToS on their website or their own scanning app does **not** tell us what data is scanned and what exactly they will do with it.\
As of writing, archived here: 
- Website 1: https://cdn.gls.cx/41fb30ea18f9631b
- Website 2: https://cdn.gls.cx/a665190b66c33c66 
- App (Same ToS as website): https://cdn.gls.cx/fec66d0aee8e0206

There are only 2 hints we get as to the data that they collect. 

First are the result pages people publicly share in their discord. An example of which can be found here: https://scan.echo.ac/cd36a1b1-9744-41b8-b8b3-83ca9bff1cfd. Not much information can really be extrapolated from here, most unfortunately. 

Second, the policy that they publish. This policy is supposed to provide some transparency as to what data echo collects. It is assumed that, for ethical reasons if nothing else - a rough outline to the methods used to collect data are stated. Unfortunately, this policy is not trustworthy. You see, echo has changed is policy regarding what they collect after the following interaction. Note that they still collect this data, they just don't tell their users anymore. They aren't being open as to what information they collect, and are clearly happy to hide things from their policy if it helps them evade criticism.

Consider the following tweet.

**Since bulbasaur's tweet was posted, they removed the line in their website about storing the memory of processes on the computer, but yet they still do it!**

At the time of writing, this was their updated "What do we log?" FAQ:\

Notice the now missing statement on reading and storing process memory. Not very professional, guys...

## My (protocol) first interactions with echo.ac publicly
On the 24th of May, 2023 I posted a tweet simply sharing some concerns I had with echo.ac, sharing a tria.ge link (https://tria.ge/230524-sdapbsda39/behavioral1#report) and my personal thoughts on echo.ac and screensharing as a whole.

Said tweet is located here: https://twitter.com/WindowsKernel/status/1661424238803156997, screenshotted version here: https://cdn.gls.cx/5c91602e6d41fec2.

At the time, my tweet was only interacted with by my own followers, and did not garner many likes. However, shortly after - The echo.ac CEO (Josh) and some developers + friends of echo.ac responded with what can only really be described as hatemail and bullying. 

Most of these can be viewed as replies on the tweet, but I will screenshot them and post them for archival purposes.

Firstly, I received this message from Josh, the CEO in my DMs on his personal account. ![Josh DM](https://cdn.gls.cx/3d259502f60b4d18)

Now that youâ€™ve read that, I would like to remind you of the severe vulnerabilities in their kernel driver, which made these exploits possible.

I also received frankly copious amounts of hatemail and harassment on the tweet, which I found very perplexing - as none of these people followed me!

This account was inactive for years, and made its first replies to me.

This user owns his own "Screensharing tool".

Here's a list of most of their staff and support team, which you can correlate to some of the replies I received.

Other people have pointed out in my tweet that this level of intrusive scanning poses a serious privacy risk.

I was also blocked by him on echo.ac's official company account. ![Blocked](https://cdn.gls.cx/a667763dbcbae333)

He also deleted this tweet after I called him out for making no sense.

Overall, really weird behaviour from a registered company with many paying users. Not a great look.


# Company Response
On the 29th of June, 2023 I (protocol) contacted the CEO of `Inspect Element Ltd.`(which own echo.ac) about disclosing my findings before going public, His response to me was personally - pretty appalling. Our conversation was as follows (Screenshots).

Finally, And a screenshot of his profile.\

After this conversation, I was then **banned from their discord server.** for the crime of...trying to help resolve a vulnerability? Wonderful.\
![Banned](https://cdn.gls.cx/376db515dc954124)


Overall I felt pretty brushed off by his response, which is disappointing - as I was trying to amicably help resolve this issue, even considering the past interactions echo.ac and his developers had with me.
Quite frankly, echo.ac as a whole is ran very unprofessionally - especially apparent when their own developers, community support, and CEO starts using insults against me as a defence. Not a great look for an anticheat company, which claims their support can be "your saviour" (???)\
