## What does echo do with all this data?
Echo.ac is pretty quiet about the data it collects and why. Their own ToS on their website or their own scanning app does **not** tell us what data is scanned and what exactly they will do with it.\

- App (Same ToS as website): https://cdn.gls.cx/fec66d0aee8e0206

The only hints we get are the result pages people publicly share in their discord. An example of which can be found here: https://scan.echo.ac/cd36a1b1-9744-41b8-b8b3-83ca9bff1cfd. This software is clearly running many intrusive scans and storing it on echo.ac's servers, while being very unclear about exactly what they store.

# My (protocol) first interactions with echo.ac publicly
On the 24th of May, 2023 I posted a tweet simply sharing some concerns I had with echo.ac, sharing a tria.ge link (https://tria.ge/230524-sdapbsda39/behavioral1#report) and my personal thoughts on echo.ac and screensharing as a whole.

Said tweet is located here: https://twitter.com/WindowsKernel/status/1661424238803156997, screenshotted version here: https://cdn.gls.cx/5c91602e6d41fec2.

At the time, my tweet was only interacted with by my own followers, and did not garner many likes. However, shortly after - The echo.ac CEO (Josh) and some developers + friends of echo.ac responded with what can only really be described as hatemail and bullying. 

Most of these can be viewed as replies on the tweet, but I will screenshot them and post them for archival purposes.

Firstly, I received this message from Josh, the CEO in my DMs on his personal account. ![Josh DM](https://cdn.gls.cx/3d259502f60b4d18)

I was then blocked by him on echo.ac's official company account, which I find pretty childish. ![Blocked](https://cdn.gls.cx/a667763dbcbae333)

I also received copious amounts of hatemail and harassment on the tweet, which was weird as none of these people followed me.

This account was inactive for years, and made its first replies to me. ![Reply 4](https://cdn.gls.cx/c5f75a0871cba519)


This user owns his own "Screensharing tool".

Here's a list of most of their staff and support team, which you can correlate to some of the replies I received.

Other people have pointed out in my tweet that this level of intrusive scanning poses a serious privacy risk.

Especially considering there is the real risk that their could be very sensitive data in the memory of scanned processes, as pointed out again here by other users.

**Another very concerning point is that since bulbasaur's tweet was posted, they removed the line in their website about storing the memory of processes on the computer, but yet they still do it!**

At the time of writing, this was their updated "What do we log?" FAQ: ![faq](https://cdn.gls.cx/777c3b6e8dbb01d9)\
Notice the now missing statement on process memory. Shocking.

# Company Response
- On the 29th of June, 2023 I (protocol) contacted the CEO of `Inspect Element Ltd.`(which own echo.ac) about disclosing my findings before going public, His response to me was personally - pretty appalling. Our conversation was as follows (Screenshots).

- Finally, And a screenshot of his profile.

- After this conversation, I was then **banned from their discord server.** for the crime of...trying to help resolve a vulnerability? Wonderful.
- ![Banned](https://cdn.gls.cx/376db515dc954124)
- Overall I felt pretty brushed off by his response, which is disappointing, as I was trying to amicably help resolve this issue, even considering the past interactions echo.ac and his developers had with me (Documented later on).

Quite frankly, echo.ac as a whole is ran very unprofessionally - especially apparent when their own developers, community support, and CEO starts using insults against me as a defence. Lovely.
