## A PoC and writeup on vulnerabilties discovered in echo.ac's driver.

## ðŸ’• Credits

- Whanos: https://github.com/Whanos/ - Initial discovery, first contact with echo.ac, writing.
- Lemon (Wishes to stay anonymous) - Exploit development and assistance.
- kite03: https://github.com/kite03/ - Exploit development, and writing.

## Background
echo.ac is a commercial "screensharing tool", marketed and developed mostly for the Minecraft PvP community, but also used by some other game communities, such as Rust.
A "screensharing tool" is a program developed to "assist" server admins in identifying if someone's using cheats or similar banned external tools ingame - As such, these programs execute numerous intrusive scans on users computer, while being very vague of what they data collect and why.

When this point was brought up to them, they reacted aggressively and attacked us for criticising this practice. We think that it is unfair that users can be banned for not wanting to run this invasive software.

I (Whanos/protocol) also attempted to disclose this exploit to the CEO in private before disclosing it publicly, but they brushed me off and then banned me from their discord server.

To read our frankly, unprofessional experiences with the staff team of this company, and to see the company's appalling response to us disclosing this exploit to them, read https://github.com/kite03/echoac-poc/blob/main/Writeup.md. it's honestly quite damning.

We **strongly** recommend reading the above document after you finish this one. Thanks.

## The Main Memory IOCTL Bug (CVE ID requested)
### A working privilege escalation PoC can be found in the PoC folder!

`echo-free.exe` deploys a Kernel driver named `echo_driver.sys`, which it uses mainly to scan process memory to "check for cheats".

A local attacker can send a series of specially crafted IOCTLs to the driver, which allows an attacker to arbitrarily read, query, and interact with process memory and kernel memory.

The IOCTL attack series is as followed:
- Deploy the driver (if not loaded already) using the command ```sc create EchoDrv binpath= C:\PathToDriver.sys type= kernel``` and then start it with `sc start EchoDrv`
- Attain a handle to the device with `DeviceIoControl` on device path `\\\\.\\EchoDrv`
- Call IOCTL `0x9e6a0594` with no input buffer, but set an output void* buffer of length `4096`. This is to bypass an internal check in the driver.
- Call IOCTL `0xe6224248` using the following structure as an input, setting the PID to your current program and program access as needed.
  - ```
    struct k_get_handle {
        DWORD pid;
        ACCESS_MASK access;
        HANDLE handle;
    };
    ```
  - This returns a HANDLE to yourself, which is checked by the driver on each memory call.
- `malloc` a new buffer of your wanted type and size, then call IOCTL `0x60a26124` using the following structure to ask the driver to execute `MmCopyVirtualMemory` on your arguments, passing in your previously attained handle.
  - ```
    struct k_param_readmem {
        HANDLE targetProcess;
        void* fromAddress;
        void* toAddress;
        size_t length;
        void* padding;
        uint32_t returnCode;
    };
    ```
  - The requested data will be located in the buffer indicated by `toAddress`.
- Close the driver handle, and then use command `sc stop EchoDrv && sc delete EchoDrv` to stop and remove the driver from the Kernel.

## Extra Driver Info
- The driver was built on June 18th 2021, so presumably all client program versions from that point onwards are vulnerable.
- The vulnerable driver's SHA256 hash is `ea3c5569405ed02ec24298534a983bcb5de113c18bc3fd01a4dd0b5839cd17b9`.


## Remediations
From reading the code, it's clear that the developers responsible have knowledge about securing drivers that is critically close to zero. As such, we recommend the following articles from Microsoft's blog, detailing how to secure and validate IOCTL requests, and how to secure your driver.

Now, we implore you to read the second document pertaining to the interactions between echo.ac and us. https://github.com/kite03/echoac-poc/blob/main/Writeup.md.
